# Cluster_Snap

Cluster Snap is a web app that allows a user to get group photos that include them without having to keep or sort through all of the photos, saving them time and storage space. When a photo is uploaded, the app identifies the faces in it and arranges them according to the users who have been identified. Each identified user gets a separate album with all their photos allowing them to get the photos they need seamlessly. Upload group photos, arrange them by faces using ML and share them with ease. ðŸ¤³ðŸ¤–
